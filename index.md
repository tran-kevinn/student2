## Welcome to Kevin's Blog! 
Hello! My name is Kevin Tran, and I am a 11th grade student at Del Norte High School in San Diego, California. Some of my hobbies include drawing, listening to music, playing the piano, swimming, and record collecting. This website will tell you a little more about me!

        <td>I had problems install some of the software tools (Python and Juypter Notebook) and with changing the theme. I searched up the issue on Google and looked through Stack Overflow to find solutions to resolve the issue.

        <td> This week, I created a lab notebook and transferred the code from my old site to the my new site. I also added a snake game.
        <td> I learned that the 2 websites can't run on the same port, so I had to change the port. I had trouble adding an emoji apple, however, I retyped the code and it worked.
